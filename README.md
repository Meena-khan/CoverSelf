1. Please note that I have covered all the test steps in 3 tests.
2. I did not validate the whole json data of post request considerring the time constraint but I have shown it with single data , how we can compare againt the get call.
3. I could not make use of excel file to fetch the data , though I have created the method to do that, since I do not have the excel license to use in my system, hence for now passed the data directly to the test method.
